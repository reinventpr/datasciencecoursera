##
##	Goal: create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
##	1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
##	2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
##	3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
##	4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
##	5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
